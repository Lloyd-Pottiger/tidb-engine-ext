//! TiKV - A distributed key/value database
//!
//! TiKV ("Ti" stands for Titanium) is an open source distributed
//! transactional key-value database. Unlike other traditional NoSQL
//! systems, TiKV not only provides classical key-value APIs, but also
//! transactional APIs with ACID compliance. TiKV was originally
//! created to complement [TiDB], a distributed HTAP database
//! compatible with the MySQL protocol.
//!
//! [TiDB]: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb
//!
//! The design of TiKV is inspired by some great distributed systems
//! from Google, such as BigTable, Spanner, and Percolator, and some
//! of the latest achievements in academia in recent years, such as
//! the Raft consensus algorithm.
